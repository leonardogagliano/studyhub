- Framework is a "structure" that holds the parts of a project together. Essentially, it's a set of generic codes which provides specific functionalities that can be reused. A framework is different from a normal library because of the following features:
- - non-modifiable framework code: usually, a framework is not supposed to be modifiable, but can accept extensions. So, a user can extend the framework, but cannot modify its code.
- - extensibility: a user can extend the framework code, generally through the overriding method.
